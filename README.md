# pos_blockchain
This project is an implementation of a Proof of Stake blockchain, where participants stake cryptocurrency to validate transactions and create new blocks. Unlike Proof of Work (PoW), PoS selects validators based on their stake rather than computational power, making it more energy-efficient.
